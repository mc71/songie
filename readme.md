To create a MIDI file from the provided scientific pitch notation, you can use the mido library in Python. First, you'll need to install it with pip install mido. Then, you can use the songie.py script to convert the notation to a MIDI file. This script creates a MIDI file called output.mid with the provided structure and scientific pitch notation. You can then play the MIDI file with any compatible software or further edit it with a digital audio workstation.
